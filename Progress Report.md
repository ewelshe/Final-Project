So far I have tested my shape memory alloy and heated it in different ways. I attatched the shape memory alloy to paper to see if 
it changes the shape of the paper. First I heated the shape memory alloy with a heat gun and watched it contract but what I have 
discovered from this is that it contracts and stays in that state. The shape memory alloy shrunk a significant amount, about half of its 
size and stayed that way even when it cooled down. 

I then connected the wire to a cirquit and arduino to turn the heat running through the cirquit on and off. I wrote the code
for this and then attempted to add a temperature sensor. I wrote the code to measure the temperature so now I have to make it so that 
when it is above a certain temperature the the wire is heated up and when it is below that temperature it stays in its original form.

I have tested enough to begin to knit my scarf and thread the shape memory alloy through, after I thread it through I need to 
connect all of the wire together to my arduino. I have coded most of it I just need to weave the wire through the scarf. 
This week I will be doing test swatches of the scarf to see what yarn thickness will work best for me. I then will weave the
shape memory alloy through the scarf and connect it to an arduino so that when it is worn and the temperature changes at a 
certain threshold it will change shape.
