# Final-Project

Summary-
I am going to create a fashionable wearable scarf. This scarf will be temperature sensitive to the environment, it will have a temperature sensor on the scarf and when the sensor measures that the temperature is warm or cool the scarf will change shape. I wanted to create this temperature sensitive scarf because I find myself getting cold easily and would like a peice of clothing that can be worn when it is both warm and cool outside. If I am wearing something but it is hot out, it is a pain to carry my piece of clothing. I wanted something that I could still wear, but could keep me either warm or cool depending on the outside temperature.  The original shape of the scarf will be a large and wide scarf. When the temperature outside gets warmer, the scarf will shrink and contract in size, therefore cooling the person down because it is barely covering them, which allows the person to still wear the scarf even when it is too warm outside. 

Components-
I will be knitting my scarf myself with yarn. I will then weave shape memory alloy into the scarf and when the temperature sensor reaches a certain temperature, the alloy will contract because it is temperature sensitive. I will need to purchase alloy. I also will need a temperature sensor and battery for my scarf to be powered. I will need to connect all of these pieces to my arduino board for everything to be programmed to run!

Challenges-
I assume my main challenges will be weaving the alloy into the scarf, I hear it is a tricky material to work with. I also think the most challening aspect will be putting everything together and having my scarf change shape properly. I think it will also be difficult to write the code and connecting all of the different pieces together successfuly.  

Project Timeline-
I will need to create my scarf wihtin the next week or so, I will then need to weave the alloy into the scarf and begin testing the contraction in the following weeks. I need to connect all the componenets and test if they all run correctly. I will be finishing this project in the next 5 weeks with several stages.
