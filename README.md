# Final-Project

Summary-
I am going to create a fashionable wearable scarf. This scarf will be temperature sensitive to the environment, it will have a temperature sensor on the scarf and when the sensor measures that the temperature is warm or cool the scarf will change shape. I wanted to create this temperature sensitive scarf because I find myself getting cold easily and would like a peice of clothing that can be worn when it is both warm and cool outside. If I am wearing something but it is hot out, it is a pain to carry my piece of clothing. I wanted something that I could still wear, but could keep me either warm or cool depending on the outside temperature.  The original shape of the scarf will be a large and wide scarf. When the temperature outside gets warmer, the scarf will shrink and contract in size, therefore cooling the person down because it is barely covering them, which allows the person to still wear the scarf even when it is too warm outside. 

Components-
I will be knitting my scarf myself with yarn. I will then weave shape memory alloy into the scarf and when the temperature sensor reaches a certain temperature, the alloy will contract because it is temperature sensitive. I will need to purchase alloy. I also will need a temperature sensor and battery for my scarf to be powered. I will need to connect all of these pieces to my arduino board for everything to be programmed to run!

Challenges-
I assume my main challenges will be weaving the alloy into the scarf, I hear it is a tricky material to work with. I also think the most challening aspect will be putting everything together and having my scarf change shape properly. I think it will also be difficult to write the code and connecting all of the different pieces together successfuly.  

Project Timeline-
I will need to create my scarf wihtin the next week or so, I will then need to weave the alloy into the scarf and begin testing the contraction in the following weeks. I need to connect all the componenets and test if they all run correctly. I will be finishing this project in the next 5 weeks with several stages. 



Summary post project-

I have created a working prototype of my shape changing scarf. The shape memory alloy works by starting off bended because the scarf is scrunched up. Then if the temperature is above 75 degrees the scarf will expand! I tested the shape memory alloy and used different materials to see which would be the easiest to change shape. I knitted a small prototype of my large scarf and wove shape memory alloy through it and used silver crimp beads to secure the shape memory alloy throughout the scarf. I found that I was only able to run current through the shape memory alloy seperatly for each piece. I thought I would be able to connect all of them at the end and have only 1 connection on each side,there was not enough current to change the shape of all the shape memory alloy. I want to create a large version of this scarf and will run current through every individual piece of shape memory alloy, I need to figure out a clean and simple way to include all of those wires in a scarf. 

I am very happy about my project because it works! My idea has carried throughout the entire project and made into a true shape changing scarf based on the temperature. I learned how to work with shape memory alloy which was a huge feat because it is extremely finicky and easy to waste the material. I learned how to include a temperature sensor in my project and I also learned how to knit! I learned how to run current through my shape memory alloy and to correctly wire my arduino and write code that works!
